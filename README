CCN Car Racing Game
by Zening Qu 05/08/2012 quzening@gmail.com

This is a multiplayer on-line car racing game using Content Centric Network (CCN) as its network component. We want to make a game that is scalable, synchronized and purely distributed on CCN.

Feature List:
- Use CCN Synchronization protocol and CCN Repository Protocol to do game discovery and player discovery.
- After game and players are discovered, normal interest/content will be sent/received for state synchronization such as position, rotation etc. Prediction/Error Correction algorithms will be used.
